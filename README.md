A quick line for a blooming writer who is interested in the tech world. 

As we've been coming into a world where technology has been the saving grace to many people, whether it's those who work from home or those who want to keep in touch with friends and family, the tech world has been booming. With the direction of careers steering towards those done from behind the screen many have been looking to tech jobs as a lucrative career move. I am no different. In my many years of eclectic work experience, it was always easy to see how things were changing and moving forward. Things became more obsolete and the new tech was coming out to simplify jobs in a retail and food service setting. You could even see technology taking over some of those positions.
  But where new technology comes into play you need those who understand how it works. People who can aid in understanding how things function and if anything goes wrong who can troubleshoot the issue. So even though it seems that technology will take over industries that we have relied on people to perform. There will always be people needed to nurture the tech. This is just a small opinion of my experience in quick changing world.
